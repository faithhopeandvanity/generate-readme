# **generate-readme**

README generator that uses Node's Inquirer package!

This is the first Challenge that doesn't involve an app deployment, thus meaning the app is _not run in the browser_

Instead, you will be running my app through _Node_.

# To use:
1: Please ensure you have Node, Git Bash and VS Code installed.

2: Go to my [GitHub repo](github.com/faithhopeandvanity/generate-readme/) and click the big green _'Code' button_, then choose _'SSH'_ and _copy the link_ that comes up.

3: Open terminal using Git Bash, navigate using 'cd' to the directory you want the app to be in, then type *'git clone'* and past the link after. Then press enter.

4: Type *'npm init -y'* to get Node Package Manager (NPM), and then *'npm install inquirer'* to get NPM's 'inquirer' package.

5: Make sure your command line is on the *generate-readme* repo, then enter *'code .'* to open VS Code.

6: In VS Code, click on the three small dots beside 'Run', then 'Terminal', then 'New Terminal'.

7: Type *'node index.js'* into the terminal to run the app!

8: The new readme will be sent to the 'new' folder. When done, navigate to the folder to find it!

# Made using:

*Node, Node Package Manager, Inquirer Package, JavaScript.*
